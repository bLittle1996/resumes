Hey Ben,

When making a new resume or updating it with new content or sections - make sure to create a new branch as vYYYY-MM-DD.

If you are making adjustments, such as wording changes or applying feedback, to an existing one, simply checkout to its branch and update it.

The `master` branch should always reflect the latest resume.

Ideally try to keep it to one page for now, and save it by using the Save as PDF feature when printing the page in a browser.
