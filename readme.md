Hey Ben,

When making a new resume or updating it with new content or sections - make sure to create a new branch as vYYYY-MM-DD.

If you are making adjustments, such as wording changes or applying feedback, to an existing one, simply checkout to its branch and update it.

The `master` branch should always reflect the latest resume.
